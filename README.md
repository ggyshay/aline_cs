# Aline Control Surface

## How to install

- In the green `code` drop down there is the `Download ZIP` button. Download and unzip the folder
- Rename the folder to Aline
- Manually create a folder called “Remote Scripts” within your User Library
- The default User Library location:
- Windows: \Users\[username]\Documents\Ableton\User Library
- Mac: Macintosh HD/Users/[username]/Music/Ableton/User Library
- Place the unzipped remote script into the "Remote Scripts" folder you just created.
- Launch Live.
- Connect Aline
- Open Live's Preferences → MIDI tab.
- Select the `Aline` script using the dropdown menu in the Control Surface column.
- Assign Aline as the input.

## How does it work

This control surface allows you to insert the frozen clip from aline directly into ableton.
When you press shift + B within the index mode the instrument is frozen and a new midi clip will show up in Ableton with the content of your resulting sequence.
